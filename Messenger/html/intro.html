        <h3>Kids won't listen?<br/> Feeling unappreciated?</h3>
        
        <p>We are parents and know raising kids is hard work.  And it's only getting harder with the kids glued to their cell phones.</p>

        <p>We figured out how to turn the tables, and to use those same cell phones and tablets to help manage the kids - to get them to listen to you, appreciate what you do for them, and to get them to start helping out.  The result?   <strong>Less stress for the parents, and kids that are learning life skills</strong>.</p>

        <p>Parenting isn't easy, so please don't expect a list of "10 things to fix your family".  Instead, we have broken down the challenge into many <strong>Family Life Skills</strong>, and for each one we provide a set of approaches that work for us.</p>
        
        <p><i>NOTE: Each kid you want to manage needs an iOS device, either an old iPhone (it doesn't need a data plan if you have WiFi), an iPod or Apple tablet.
